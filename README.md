# Hand Gesture Tracking and Recognition by Fully-Convolutional Siamese Network

## Introduction
This repository contains the codes and results to track hand gesture and recognise on my own dataset. This project is the Pytorch implementation of Fully-Convolutional Siamese Network.  
The project is divided into four major parts : **Training, Evaluation, Tracking, Recognise.**

## Download Dataset
